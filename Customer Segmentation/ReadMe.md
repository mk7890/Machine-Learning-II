# Customer Segmentation
## Overview (Introduction)
Customer segmentation is a common technique used in marketing to divide customers into groups based on similar characteristics, such as purchasing behavior or demographics. By segmenting customers, businesses can gain valuable insights to tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service.

## Models
To perform clustering, I used K-Means Clustering (A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into k groups based on similarity).

## Visualization
I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize high-dimensional data and improve clustering performance.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluating clustering models is challenging as there are no ground truth labels. I used the following metrics and techniques:

- Elbow Method & Silhouette Score (for K-Means): To determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualization: Using PCA to visualize the clusters in 2D and 3D space.
